#$ARGUMENTS
</github_isssue>
1- git worktree add ./.trees/feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS -b feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS
2- cd .trees/feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS
5- activate plan mode on
6- analyze the github issue #$ARGUMENTS and determine with the @project-coordinator subagent what subagents from the folder @.cursor/agents should be involved in implement this issue. @project-coordinator should determine if the agents can run in parallel if there is no overlaping on tasks, even run parallel instances of the same agent if is needed or possible, ALWAYS show the plan to the user to confirm
7- Agents must work in TDD, functionality by functionality, step by step. Don't create the full set of test and then the full functionality code, decouple the functionality in small pieces and test then develop step by step
8- at the end after the confirmation of the user, commit the changes and push them to the branch

**TDD Workflow:**
- Write a failing test first (pytest for backend, Vitest/Jest for frontend)
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Refactor if needed
- Repeat for each small piece of functionality

**Backend TDD:**
- Use pytest for Python/FastAPI tests
- Test domain logic first, then application layer, then infrastructure
- Mock external dependencies

**Frontend TDD:**
- Use Vitest (preferred) or Jest for React tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
